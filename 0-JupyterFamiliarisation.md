# Getting Started With Jupyter

`Jupyter` is a web based user interface project, primarily for interacting with `python`, but can also run as a Markdown, `R` or even `LaTeX` processing interface. 

`JupyterLab` service that you can run on your local machine (or almost [anywhere](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/))

Follow the instructions at [The Main Project Page](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) to get Jupyter up and running and try the following tasks on your own and with judicious googling.

## TODO
* Create a new python notebook in this folder
* Display 'hello world' using the `print` function
* Create a variable `output` containing the string 'hello world' and display it **without using the `print` function**
* Create a Markdown Cell with a Header and some text

## Bonus Round
* Try opening a CSV file in Jupyter Lab
* Try opening an Image file in Jupyter Lab
* Try creating a Markdown File in Jupyter Lab
* Try closing the Jupyter Lab tab and reopening it (usually https://localhost:8888)
* Try shutting down and restarting Jupyter Lab
* Try installing a package from within a Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab
