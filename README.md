# python_data_workshop
Workshop Materials for an all-day workshop on Practical Python for Data Science

## Prerequisites

* You should be comfortable with Python
* If you want to run these locally, use Docker to grab a [`jupyter stack`](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* If you just want to follow along and play, check out the [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andrewbolster/python_data_workshop/HEAD) *You won't get everything this way, but it's fine for review sessions*

# Caveat

This is my first 'big' workshop and I think I simultaneously tried to do too much and still ended up with too little. Feedback, advice, corrections, and complaints are welcome in the Issues, as I would like to refine this workshop for future use.

Or just throw it out if it's a crime against data.
