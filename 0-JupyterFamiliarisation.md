# Getting Started With Jupyter

`Jupyter` is a web based user interface project, primarily for interacting with `python`, but can also run as a Markdown, `R` or even `LaTeX` processing interface. 

`JupyterLab` service that you can run on your local machine (or almost [anywhere](https://www.dataschool.io/cloud-services-for-jupyter-notebook/))

Follow the instructions at [The Main Project Page](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) to get Jupyter up and running and try the following tasks on your own and with judicious googling.

First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of languages. However, each notebook is associated with a single kernel. This notebook is associated with the IPython kernel, therefore runs Python code.

Run a code cell using Shift-Enter or pressing the 

There are two other keyboard shortcuts for running code:

* `Alt-Enter` runs the current cell and inserts a new one below.

* `Ctrl-Enter` run the current cell and enters command mode.


## TODO
* Create a new python notebook in this folder
* Display 'hello world' using the `print` function
* Create a variable `output` containing the string 'hello world' and display it **without using the `print` function**
* Create a Markdown Cell with a Header and some text

## BOLSTERS OVERSIGHTS

* Cell execution
* Sample CSV

## Bonus Round
* Try opening a CSV file in Jupyter Lab
* Try opening an Image file in Jupyter Lab
* Try creating a Markdown File in Jupyter Lab
* Try closing the Jupyter Lab tab and reopening it (usually https://localhost:8888)
* Try shutting down and restarting Jupyter Lab
* Try installing a package from within a Jupyter Notebook in Jupyter Lab
