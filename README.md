# Caveat

This is my first 'big' workshop and I think I simultaneously tried to do too much and still ended up with too little. Feedback, advice, corrections, and complaints are welcome in the Issues, as I would like to refine this workshop for future use.

Or just throw it out if it's a crime against data.
